*This is mildly a response to to Paul Graham's article, [Hackers and Painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html), which is brilliant, despite the argument I make below.*

It's pretty standard for universities throughout the world to uphold the idea that math and computer science are pretty much siblings. At the very least, they must be good pals, and if you want to hang out with one, you better plan on being friends with the other.

The trouble is that when it comes to writing code—the stuff that, used properly, actually makes  a computer feel less like a crude science experiment and more like a magical tool for humans—this is codependency upheld in academia isn't the reality. Programmers are more like [composers](http://ryangtanaka.com/music-composition-similar-to-software-programming/) or novelists than they are like mathematicians.

A lot of [thoughtful people](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/07/15/programming-is-not-math/), with more much more experience than me, have made this argument very well. And I completely agree with them.

Except, maybe, on one point: perhaps mathematicians aren't that much like mathematicians either?

This is where I think a lot of well meaning programmers have incorrectly drawn a line between the overlapping disciplines of math and computer craft. The problem is that it’s so easy to draw a line there: most people hate math. School has done a very good job of convincing an overwhelming majority that math is just [outright ridiculous](http://euclid.nmu.edu/~jophilli/essays/math-aesth.html). It's worse than that though—it's cold, it's methodically, it's unfeeling and temperamental.

Why is it then, that [mathematicians love math so much](http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/jobs-rated-report-2015-ranking-top-200-jobs)? Are they just cold, unfeeling people—constantly wandering the the border between genius and sociopath? They probably aren't. I’m making this assumption anecdotally, but [I think it's a fair one](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/the-team).

I was fortunate in school to have math teachers that loved math—and their love of math was clearly demonstrated by how well they took care of their students. You might be able to argue that math is also to blame for all of the terrible teachers everyone else had, but I don't think we should. So, again, why is that so many people who do math love it?

I think it's because math is very lovable. Real math, [detached from bad grades in 10th grade and towering times tables in third](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/from-fish-to-infinity/), is incredibly beautiful. It's abstract, but entirely relevant. We aren't even sure if it's something real and transcendent or [something made up](https://youtu.be/TbNymweHW4E). Mathematicians could be the real-life witches and wizards: ordinary people that work hard to abstract things to a point that they become relevant and useful to everyone around them.

And this, I think, is why it's a bad idea for us as programmers to completely disassociate ourselves from mathematicians. Programmers have a lot of work to do if they are going to convince the world that code is poetry—and while we’re doing it, it might be better take the extra step and let them know that math probably is too, rather than cutting it out of the story. Our code depends a lot on the abstractions imagined by mathematicians before us—thousands of years before us! If we exclude them, just because it's the easy thing to do, we've left out an entire branch of code’s rich history, which, yes, also includes painters and composers and architects and more.

Ultimately, the reality the we want people to see is that our discipline as programmers is part of the greater human story, and that it extends from the richest parts of that history. If we are too quick to hide our dependency on mathematics, just because people don’t like math, then we're only perpetuating the ignorance surrounding [our own craft](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) as well as the distrust of math’s own [creative beauty](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-h-bailey/why-mathematics-matters_b_4794617.html).
